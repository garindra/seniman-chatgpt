# seniman-chatgpt
A fast, light ChatGPT UI built with [Seniman](https://github.com/senimanjs/seniman). Loads with only 3KB of JS upfront, and uses WebSockets to stream the interface on-the-fly.

## Network Performance
Compared to OpenAI's native `chat.openai.com`'s frontend:

#### OpenAI
- Downloads 600KB of JS upfront 
- ~160KB of data per message (short code block + 5 sentence paragraph)

#### Seniman
- Downloads 3KB of JS upfront & 3KB of websocket messages to set up UI
- ~5KB of WS data per message of same size
